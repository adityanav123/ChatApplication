# ChatApplication
Chat Application using Network Programming in Java

## Execution : 


```bash
java ServerExample.java // Start the Server
java ClientExample.java // Connect the Client to Server
```

```
Current What It does : Connect to Server and send a message, Server will reverse the String and return to the Client.
```

What I want to do: To create a `Multi-User` Chat Application, with extra features by the side.
