# ChatApplication
Chat Application using Network Programming in Java

## Execution : 

-- Multiple Connections with Client
```
    Add Project in from ./Multithreaded/MultithreadedClientServer to IntelliJ and run from there.
```

OR

```bash
    java ./Multithreaded/MultithreadedClientServer/out/production/MultithreadedClientServer/Server // to Start the server
    java ./Multithreaded/MultithreadedClientServer/out/production/MultithreadedClientServer/Client // to Client a Client.
```
For Each connection, run the client execution command in multiple terminal instances.

```
Current What It does : Connect to Server and send a message, Server will reverse the String and return to the Client.
```

What I want to do: To create a `Multi-User` Chat Application, with extra features by the side.
